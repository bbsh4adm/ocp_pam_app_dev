= Minishift

* SSH into minishift

	minishift ssh

* Check the folders from the host system minishift has mounted

	minishift hostfolder list

* Add *hostfolder* and mount it so that it is available in minishift (side note: this was so we can build images with mariadb and add ImageStream in to cluster, also for that neeeded oc tools)

	minishift hostfolder add -t sshfs --source /home/stkousso/Stelios/Projects/0058-CGD/TASKS/ocp_pam_app_dev --target /mnt/sda1/ocp_pam_app_dev ocp_pam_app_dev
	minishift hostfolder mount ocp_pam_app_dev
 	minishift hostfolder add -t sshfs --source /home/stkousso/Stelios/sw11/PAAS/Tooling/ocp-tools/3.11.16-linux/ --target /mnt/sda1/ocp-tools ocp-tools
