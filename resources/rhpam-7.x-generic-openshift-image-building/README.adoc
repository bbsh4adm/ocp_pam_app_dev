We have taken this from 7.3.1 (last version that used the build.sh) and moved it here to re-use with future kieserver image+driver building (mysql, oracle)

Refer to https://github.com/skoussou/ocp_pam_app_dev/blob/master/resources/rhpam-7.x-generic-openshift-image-building/templates/contrib/jdbc/README.md[README.md] for the method of building the images with S2I
